subroutines which read and write spectral data files  Version 1.0 data format.
The data are stored as simple ASCII characters at a user defined number of
columns per line for the  length of the data file. The spectral data is
preceeded by a series of header lines, which tell the user about the
parameters of the spectrum. The header lines are identified by the first
character in the line being the symbol (#) followed by a descriptor  and if
appropriate its units. An example of a data file format can be found in the
EMSAMASFF.DOC file.

                           Abstract


A simple format for the exchange of digital spectral data is presented,
and has been designated as an EMSA/MAS standard.  This format is
readable by both humans and computers and is suitable for transmission
through various electronic networks (BITNET, ARPANET), the phone system
(with modems) or on physical computer storage devices (such as floppy
disks).  The format is not tied to any one computer, programming
language or computer operating system.  The adoption of a standard
format would enable different laboratories to freely exchange spectral
data, and would help to standarize data analysis software. If equipment
manufacturers were to support a common format, the microscopy and
microanalysis community would avoid duplicated effort in writing data-
analysis software.

1.INTRODUCTION

The virtues of a single standard data format have been admirably related
by various authors [1], [2], [3], [4].  It would often be convenient,
after visiting another laboratory to use a different type of
microanalytical spectrometer, to be able to return to one's own
laboratory to analyze the data, or for a laboratory to be able to send a
spectrum to another group at another location for analysis on their
computer.  A common format would also enable test spectra to be
transported between data acquisition systems, in order to compare
different data-analysis routines, and would give users greater choice of
analysis procedure, based on commercial or public-domain software.

Obviously, an ideal solution would be for the manufacturers to represent
data in a standard format, but they are unlikely to agree on this
without some direction from their customers (the microanalysis
community).  Therefore it is highly desirable for EMSA and MAS to
proceed with adoption of a standard format.  Such a format does not
preclude any research group or manufacturer from having their own,
possibly proprietary, format.  Spectral data can be stored internally in
any format, as long as there is an option to convert it to the external
standard (and vice versa) for the purposes of exchange.  We believe that
a standard format should poses the following attributes.

1.It should be capable of representing the data exactly (without
altering the scientific content).

2.The format should be simple and easy to use.

3.It must NOT be tied to any particular computer, programming language
or operating system.  It should work on a large number of computers of
all sizes, although we cannot guarantee that it will work on all
possible computers.

4.The format should be both human and machine (computer) readable.

5.It should be compatible with existing electronic communication
networks such as (but not necessarily limited to) BITNET, ARPANET, and
with the phone system (using modems).  Future networks will likely
retain compatibility with these.

6.The format should support spectra of interest to the  EMSA/MAS
community (such as XEDS, EELS, AES, etc.) and should be flexible enough
to accommodate future data sets, not yet specified.

7.Each file should contain enough information to uniquely identify the
type and origin of the spectral data and to reconstruct its
significance.

8.Where possible, the format should be compatible with various
commercial data plotting or analysis programs (i.e. spreadsheets, or
graphical analysis packages).

9.The proposed format need not be the most efficient storage mechanism.
Its primary goals, stated above, will generally prevent storage
efficiency.  If anything, this format will err on the side of simplicity
and ease of use.

The format originally employed by the Electron Microscopy and
Microanalysis Public Domain Library (EMMPDL) at Argonne [1] has the
virtue of simplicity, but is too rigid for general use.  A recent
revision [5] corrected some inadequacies, but a more serious
reexamination is in order.  The format proposed by a previous EMSA Task
Force [3,4] addresses many of the problems but is thought by some
microscopists to be too complicated for everyday use.  The VMAS format,
whose description [6] runs to 60 pages, is also too complex for our
perceived purpose.  A format, named JCAMP-DX, used by the infrared
spectroscopy community [2] is specific and detailed but is somewhat off-
target for the spectroscopies of interest to our community.

The format proposed here follows JCAMP-DX in many ways, but is less
complicated and has features tailored to x-ray, energy-loss and Auger
spectroscopies. We circulated a preliminary version of this proposal to
several manufacturers of XEDS systems and have received back comments
and suggestions, many of which have been incorporated into this
document.

The companion problem of a standard format for digital image storage is
similar to that of spectral data, but is sufficiently different to
warrant its own standard.  Whereas most spectra are sufficiently compact
that they can be stored in a human-readable form, image data are usually
so extensive as to require storage of 'raw' binary numbers. There exist
formats for image storage that are in widespread use.  One of these
(probably TIFF) should be endorsed by EMSA and MAS, allowing the
microanalysis community to take advantage of the large amount of
commercial and public-domain software already available.


2.FORMAT DESCRIPTION

The general structure of the data file format  can be summarized as a
simple sequential ASCII (text) file. It begins with a series of header
lines which serve to define the characteristics of the spectrum. These
header lines are identified by unique keyword fields which occupy the
first 15 positions of each line, followed by a data field. These are
described in detail below. After the header lines, a keyword indicates
the start of data, the data then follows on successive lines in a manner
which is defined explicitly within the header. Finally after all the
data is presented, an end of data keyword indicates the data set is
complete. This is diagramatically illustrated below.

Header Lines
*
*
Successive lines begining with EMSA/MAS defined keywords
Some of which are required and some are optional
*
*
Start of Data Keyword
*
*
Experimental Data
*
*
End of Data Keyword



In general, each line of the file either contains a keyword and its
associated value or spectral data. All header lines are readily
identified as they each begin with '#'in the first character field or
column. This symbol demarks the start of a 13 character keyword field,
providing descriptive information about the data followed by an
associated value.  EMSA/MAS defined keywords (whose definition may be
changed only by EMSA/MAS ) begin with a single # and occupy the first 13
columns (characters) of each header line.   The keyword itself consists
of at most twelve characters which directly follow the #, shorter
keywords may be employed and any remaining spaces following the defined
keyword  may be filled with descriptive text such as unit designation
for ease of legibility when the file is printed (see examples in Tables
1 and 2). If a position in the keyword field is not used it must be
filled with a space character. The keywords are not case-sensitive, so
that #Xunits is interpreted the same  as #XUNITS.

The 14th and 15th character positions (columns) in each header line are
occupied by keyword/value field separators, which consist of a colon
followed by a space. The value associated with each keyword starts in
column 16 and maybe either textual or numeric as defined by the keyword.
Each line of the file may contain no more than 79 characters (for
compatibility with the largest number of computers and computer
networks, and for general legibility on standard width CRT screens).
Since the keyword and its seperator occupies the first 15 positions,
this means that all remaining information following the keyword is
limited to a maximum of 64 (=79-15) character positions.  The end of
line indicator is a carriage return, linefeed combination (<CR&gt;<LF&gt;).

The only characters allowed in the file are the space (ASCII character
32), carriage return (ASCII character 13) and linefeed (ASCII character
10) characters, plus the printable ASCII character set given below:

!"#$% &'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=&gt;? @   (ASCII characters 33 -  64)
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ          (ASCII characters 65 -  90)
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz          (ASCII characters 97 - 122)
[\] `{|}~                 (ASCII characters 91 - 96,ASCII 123-126)


Horizontal TAB characters are NOT permitted in this file format as a
substitute for spaces or commas. Examples of keywords, seperators and
data can be found in Tables 1 and 2, and are further detailed below.

2.1 REQUIRED KEYWORDS

The following keywords are required and must appear at the beginning of
the file, in the order specified below.  Although some of these may
appear arbitrary, it is our judgment that they fulfil a long-term need.
After several years of students and outside users passing through a
laboratory, the result can be a vast number of data files of unknown
origin.  Unless some adequate form of labelling is imposed from the
start, many worthwhile data files are lost and useless data sits on a
disk taking up valuable space. With the following minimum subset of
keywords, it should be possible to reconstruct the significance of most
spectra.


Note that there must be exactly one of each required keyword, except for
the keyword #TITLE which must appear at least once but may at the users
decision appear more than once to provide an extended length title.

Required Keywords
----------------------


#FORMAT		= Character string identifies this format  as
				"EMSA/MAS Spectral Data File"
#VERSION  	= File Format Version Number (1.0 for this
				implementation)
#TITLE		= Gives a short description of the spectra
				 One or more per file. Max = 64 Characters
#DATE		= The calendar day-month-year in which the spectra
		       was recorded, in the form: DD-MMM-YYYY.
#TIME		= The time of day at which the spectrum was
			  recorded,in 24-hour format: HH:MM.
#OWNER		= The name of the person who recorded the spectrum.
#NPOINTS  	= Total Number of Data Points in X & Y Data Arrays
	         	 	1. <  NPOINTS <  4096.
#NCOLUMNS 	= Number of columns of data
	         		1. <  NCOLUMNS <  5. when DATATYPE = Y
	         		1. <  NCOLUMNS <  3. when DATATYPE = XY
#XUNITS		= Units for x-axis data, for example: eV.
#YUNITS		= Units for y-axis data, for example: counts.
#DATATYPE	     = Method in which the data values are  stored as
			  Y Axis only values  or X,Y data pairs. The
		       current options are the characters Y and XY.
#XPERCHAN	     = The number of x-axis units  per channel.
#OFFSET		= A real (but possibly negative) number
			representing  value of channel one in xunits
#SPECTRUM	     = Indicates the next line starts the spectral data
#ENDOFDATA	= Indicates the end of the data file

2.2 SPECTRAL DATA

The spectral data must be enclosed between the following keywords:

#SPECTRUM    : Signifies the beginning of spectral data (on the
		      next line).

#ENDOFDATA   : Signifies the end of spectral data.

Between these keywords, the spectrum is listed in one of two ways, as
specified by the #DATATYPE value.

In the case of spectra with equally-spaced x-values (equal increments
per channel), up to #NCOLUMNS y-values may be given per line. For Y-axis
datatype 1 <  #NCOLUMNS < 5. Each y-value is either a real number
(containing a decimal point, even if there is no fractional component)
or is expressed in exponential form (e.g. 3.142E+3), and is followed
immediately by a comma. The corresponding x-values can be obtained from
the specified values of #XPERCHAN and #OFFSET or #CHOFFSET.

If the user prefers, data may be stored as (x,y) pairs of data points,
at #NCOLUMNS per line. For XY-axis datatype <  #NCOLUMNS <  3. The x-
and y-values are expressed as real numbers or in exponential format, and
are separated with a comma. The (x,y) pairs themselves are separated by
a comma followed by at least one blank space.

The reason for avoiding the use of integer numbers is that in some
instances decimal values are generated, for example if energy- loss
spectra have been scaled for normalization or to remove a gain change.
If necessary the decimal point and the comma can be removed with a text
editor (using a global replace) to give integer values, whereas the
reverse process may not be straightforward.

Numbers less than unity can be represented either with or without a zero
preceding the decimal point (e.g. 0.1 or .1). In the case of negative
numbers, there should be no spaces between the minus sign and the
numerical value. We recommend that there should be no trailing spaces
after a number (preceding the comma).  The (x,y) option has been
included to accommodate segmented spectra, containing gaps where y-data
are not specified, and to allow for the possibility that the x-axis
scale is nonlinear. In addition, it makes the data compatible with most
general-purpose graph-plotting software packages. In some future version
of the format, this option could be extended by the addition of x and y
spatial coordinates, to allow for x-ray maps or energy-selected images,
but more a compact representation based on a TIFF standard might be more
attractive.


2.3  OPTIONAL KEYWORDS

All optional keywords except #CHECKSUM must appear before the keyword
#SPECTRUM and after #CHOFFSET.  If used, the check-sum value should be
the last line in the file and is the integer summation of all characters
in the file, excluding the last line containing the checksum itself, and
excluding any trailing spaces after the line terminator.  This option is
provided to test the integrity of data transmission and/or storage.

With one exception, the keywords listed below require the user to
specify an associated value as a real number (with a decimal point and
not more than 20 characters in length, including the decimal point) or
as an ASCII character string < 64 characters long. The exception is
#CHECKSUM, which requires a signed integer value.  For ease of
classification we have grouped the optional keywords in order of their
function, thus keywords dealing with the spectrum, type of spectroscopy,
specimen are presented together in the following listing. This grouping
is not required within the file format, however, it is strongly
recommended. In the keyword list below the abbreviation [RN] means the
keyword is a real number while [nCS] indicates a character string of n
characters.

#CHECKSUM    = 32 BIT INTEGER NUMBER

The #CHECKSUM optional keyword and values is used to test for data
transmission errors in the file. The check sum is calculated by adding
the ASCII values of all characters in the file, including spaces and
line terminators. Trailing blanks (on each line) and the last line
containing the checksum itself are excluded from this sum. If the
calculated checksum agrees with that stored in the data file, the user
can be reasonably sure that data set has been faithfully transmitted.

Optional user-defined keywords may be also included within the header of
the data file. These keywords must begin with the double ## sign and
follow all EMSA/MAS defined keywords, except for the start of data
#SPECTRUM keyword.All field restrictions as outlined above apply to
user-defined keywords and their values.  These user defined allow for
expansion of this file structure to cover items that have not yet been
explicitly defined by the EMSA/MAS Task Force.

2.4  ENDING A FILE

The last line of every file should be either an #ENDOFDATA or a
#CHECKSUM line. The #ENDOFDATA keyword must immediately follow the
spectral data, if present the #CHECKSUM keyword must follow the
#ENDOFDATA keyword.

COMPILATION, LINKING AND TESTING PROCEDURE


=============================================================


The following procedure can be used to compile EMMFF using
IBM Professional Fortran Compiler by Ryan-McFarland Corp (1984)


C:&gt;PROFORT EMMFF.SRC/L&gt;EMMFF.LST
C:&gt;LINK EMMFF




The following is a partial example of the I/O for EMMFF
at the present time all I/O options of the program
will not be demonstrated below.

Using EMMFF you may:

1.) Read an EMSA/MAS File
2.) Write an EMSA/MAS File
3.) Read and/or Edit (Modify) a System Parameters File
    which contains defaults for your Spectroscopy system
4.) Translate EMMPDL files into EMSA/MAS files

c This subroutine  READS the EMSA/MAS Spectrum File Format.
c The results  from the file are stored locally in predefined
c arrays. These arrays can be passed directly back to the main
c program and can be used to redirect data elsewhere as needed.
c In this implementation the arrays are passed in labeled common
c blocks. They can alternatively be passed as subroutine
c arguments.

c
c             Compare the version number are we version 1.0?
c             if not you need a different routine

c
c Okay we have a legal Format and Version number
c we now read in all keywords as predefined by EMSA/MAS
c Each will be checked individually for safety, rather that
c assume the data file is perfect.
c
c
c Does the data start? Read the next line
c write it out regardless of its value and
c but look for the keyword "SPECTRUM"

c the key word not SPECT, hence there is more information
c lets read it.
c
c       first check to see how many keywords we have read in

c
       BACKSPACE (99)

c
c
c now test each predefined keyword
c
        FKEY='F'

c This subroutine MODIFIES the default settings for the current
c instrumental conditions and parameters defined in the EMSA/MAS format
c Data may be stored temporary (within the program) or permanent (as a file)
c This file may be customized by the user to reflect his/her operating
c conditions. The routine also allows individuals to have multiple
c files which reflect different operating modes to save reentering data.
c The results  from the file are stored locally in predefined
c arrays. These arrays can be passed directly back to the main
c program and can be used to redirect data elsewhere as needed.
c In this implementation the arrays are passed in labeled common
c blocks. They can alternatively be passed as subroutine

c     will logically be updated when a EMSA/MAS file is written
c     to disk. These are indicated by a * when typed on the screen.

c      NOW define different arrays used only in this routine
c
c      XVALUE  & YVALUE are temporary arrays used for reading in values
c
       REAL XVALUE(10),YVALUE(10)
c
c
c The array FNAME = Name of File to be read, Usually null terminated
c so we will initialize it with zero's using a Do loop so that successive
c operations of the routine within a single program donot cause problems
c if a short filename is used.
c
c FNAME   = Byte array of 17 characters containing the filename
c KText  = Byte array of 64 characters containing Keyword text
c
c
       Character*17 FNAME
       Character*1 KTEXT(64)
       Logical*1 TF
c
c Initialize Filename
c
c
c
c
c Begin by asking the user to supply a file name
c Note the following statement is generally compiler dependant
c Note this version limits file name to 16 characters
c
c

c     Note: some of the EMMPDL keywords are not defined in the
c     EMSA/MAS headers, also some have different names for the
c     than EMSA/MAS, correct this in the read routine and store
c     the parameters as their corresponding EMSA/MAS counterparts.
c
c
c First read the Spectrum Title
c
       READ (99,125) NUM,KEY,WORD,KTEXT

c
c This subroutine  READS a default file called
c SYSPARM.DAT which contains default settings for the current
c instrumental conditions and parameters defined in the EMSA/MAS format
c This file may be customized by the user to reflect his/her operating
c conditions. The routine also allows individuals to have multiple
c files which reflect different operating modes to save reentering data.
c The results  from the file are stored locally in predefined
c arrays. These arrays can be passed directly back to the main
c program and can be used to redirect data elsewhere as needed.
c In this implementation the arrays are passed in labeled common
c blocks. They can alternatively be passed as subroutine
c arguments.

c
c     The system parameters file should be customized by the user
c     to reflect their standard conditions. The user should
c     use a simple screen editor to update the default file
c     provided. We will read all the parameters in the file
c     and if they correspond to a defined EMSA/MAS keyword then
c     store the value. If they are not standard then they will
c     be simply typed on the screen. Some of these parameters
c     will logically be updated when a EMSA/MAS file is written
c     to disk. These are indicated by a * when typed on the screen.
c
c     Note: the System Parameters file may not have all the
c     predefined EMSA/MAS keywords, but we must check for all
c     of them regardless.
